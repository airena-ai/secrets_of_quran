        "iteration_goal": "The initial architecture is designed with modularity in mind, comprising `data_loader`, `text_preprocessor`, and `logger_config` modules. `data_loader` handles loading Quran data, `text_preprocessor` performs basic text cleaning (diacritic removal, normalization), and `logger_config` sets up logging. A main script orchestrates these modules. This design supports incremental development and future scalability by clearly separating concerns and providing well-defined modules for each task."

        "iteration_goal": "The architecture will be updated by enhancing the `text_preprocessor` module with `arabic_normalization` and `tokenizer` sub-modules for improved Arabic text handling.  Normalization will address complete Arabic letter variations and Unicode artifacts. Tokenization will segment text into words. The `logger_config` will be updated to log these new preprocessing steps, improving observability. This modular design maintains separation of concerns and enhances system testability and maintainability."

        "iteration_goal": "The architecture is updated to include `lemmatizer` and `root_extractor` sub-modules within the `text_preprocessor` module. These additions will enable lemmatization and root word extraction for Arabic text using external libraries. The logging will be enhanced to capture lemmatized and root words. Integration tests will be updated to verify the correct implementation and log output of these new text processing stages, ensuring comprehensive analysis and observability."

        "iteration_goal": "Introduce a new `frequency_analyzer` module with a `count_word_frequencies` function to calculate word frequencies. Integrate this module into the `main` workflow after text preprocessing. Enhance logging to record frequency analysis results (unique word count and top frequent words). Update integration tests to verify the new functionality and logging. This modular design improves system organization and supports future extensions for advanced text analysis."

This function will calculate and log the frequency of root words in the Quran. The `main()` function will be updated to include this analysis, and integration tests and logging will be enhanced to support the new functionality. This addition reuses the existing `frequency_analyzer` module, maintaining modularity and separation of concerns."

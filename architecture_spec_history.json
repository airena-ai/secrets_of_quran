        "iteration_goal": "The initial architecture is designed with modularity in mind, comprising `data_loader`, `text_preprocessor`, and `logger_config` modules. `data_loader` handles loading Quran data, `text_preprocessor` performs basic text cleaning (diacritic removal, normalization), and `logger_config` sets up logging. A main script orchestrates these modules. This design supports incremental development and future scalability by clearly separating concerns and providing well-defined modules for each task."

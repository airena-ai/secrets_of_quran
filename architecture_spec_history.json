The design emphasizes modularity, testability, and future scalability. An integration test ensures end-to-end functionality. This foundational architecture sets the stage for incremental feature development in subsequent iterations."

A new `analyze_word_frequency()` function is added to the 'analysis' module to process preprocessed text, count word frequencies, and log the top N words along with potential 'secret' flags to `results.log`. The main program flow and integration tests are updated to incorporate this new analysis step, ensuring modularity and testability are maintained."

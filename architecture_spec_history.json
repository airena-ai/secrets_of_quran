        "iteration_goal": "A modular architecture is established for the Quran analyzer, featuring modules for main driver, file reading, text preprocessing, analysis, and logging.  The design emphasizes modularity, testability, and future scalability. An integration test ensures end-to-end functionality. This foundational architecture sets the stage for incremental feature development in subsequent iterations."

        "iteration_goal": "The architecture is extended to include a 'Word Frequency Analysis' feature. A new `analyze_word_frequency()` function is added to the 'analysis' module to process preprocessed text, count word frequencies, and log the top N words along with potential 'secret' flags to `results.log`. The main program flow and integration tests are updated to incorporate this new analysis step, ensuring modularity and testability are maintained."

        "iteration_goal": "The architecture is updated to include root word analysis functionality. A new `analyze_root_words()` function is added to the 'analysis' module, which will use an Arabic NLP library to identify root words, calculate their frequencies, and log the results. The integration test will be updated to ensure the new functionality is correctly integrated into the analysis pipeline and that root word frequencies are properly logged."

        "iteration_goal": "Introduce bigram frequency analysis feature. Add `analyze_bigrams` function to the analysis module. Integrate it into the `main()` function in `quran_analyzer.py`. Update the logging module to include bigram frequency results in `results.log`. Enhance integration tests in `test_quran_analyzer.py` to verify the new bigram analysis functionality and its logging."

The `main()` function will call this new function and log the results to `results.log`. Integration tests will be updated to verify the new functionality. This increment maintains modularity and testability while adding verse repetition analysis to the Quran analyzer."

        "iteration_goal": "Three new analysis functions (`analyze_palindromes`, `analyze_abjad_numerals`, `analyze_semantic_symmetry`) are added to the `analysis` module to implement advanced pattern detection (palindromes, Abjad numerals, semantic symmetry). The `main()` function will orchestrate these new analyses, and integration tests will be updated to ensure their correct execution and output logging. This increment maintains modularity and enhances the application's analytical capabilities without requiring significant architectural refactoring."

  Project Name: Quran Secrets Analyzer
  Purpose: Develop a Python application to search secrets of Quran. 
  
  Analyze whole Quranic text and find interesting words such as Allah, day, moon, sun, and special word groups such as bismillahirrahmanirrahim.
  Think and generate ideas about possible divine secrets and messages hidden, including but not limited to number 19. 
  This program will continue to be developed indefinetly to search an infinite space of secrets in Quran. 
  Start with word and word groups but as you advanced look for more advanced patterns and search unthinkable secrets. 
  There's no limit or restriction on what kind of search you can do on seeking the ultimate secrets of Quran. Use your imagination.

  Data Source:
  You are given {project_root}/data/quran-uthmani-min.txt Do NOT modify this file. It is the source of truth and assume this file will always be there.
  Use this file in your program to do search and run analysis.
  Each line in the file represents a unique verse and specifies surah and ayah numbers. Here are the first three lines:
  1|1|بِسمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحمٰنِ الرَّحيمِ
  1|2|الحَمدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العٰلَمينَ
  1|3|الرَّحمٰنِ الرَّحيمِ

  Analysis and Search Strategy:
  You will leverage Python's pytest framework to run the analysis and log the results. Each test case will focus on a specific search area. 
  Again the unittests will be used to run the search and analysis runtime in addition to test the validation of production code.
  Search focus can include but not be limited to words, word groups, verses, surahs or innovative new search patterns of Quran.
  
  Results:
  Not all tests and analysis will yield to a secret but the goal is to search as much search space as possible within infinte possiblities. 
  In rare circumstances, if you find a secret make sure you tag it explicitly in the output or do it in a way that is easily discovrable among possibly millions of test results.

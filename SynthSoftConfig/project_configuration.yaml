  ### Objective:
  Find secret messages in Quran based on secret code and muqatta analysis you will perform using novel strategies that haven't been explored before.

  ### Text Processing Requirements:
  
  * Data Source:
  Use only the following file (do NOT modify it):
  {project_root}/data/quran-uthmani-min.txt
  Each line contains: Surah|Ayah|Verse Text
  Example:
  1|1|بِسمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحمٰنِ الرَّحيمِ
  1|2|الحَمدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ العٰلَمينَ
  1|3|الرَّحمٰنِ الرَّحيمِ
  
  * Preprocessing:
  Normalize Arabic text before analysis:
  Remove diacritics
  Normalize Arabic letters (e.g., ى → ي, ة → ه, etc.)
  Handle invisible Unicode artifacts
  Arabic has no concept of case sensitivity

  * Linguistic Tools:
  Integrate advanced Arabic language processing tools:
  CAMeL Tools
  Arabic lemmatizers and root analyzers  

  ### Program Structure & Expectations:

  * Main Function:
  Acts as the central driver of all analyses.
  Should not be a demo or placeholder.
  Must perform a complete and verbose Quran-wide analysis.
  Must produce meaningful output for every analytical stage.

  * Logging and Output:
  Log all results to a structured file (e.g., results.log)
  Any interesting findings should be explicitly tagged with:
  POTENTIAL SECRET FOUND: [short description]

  * Testing:
  Create an integration test to run the full main() function
  No mocks or partial runs — test the full analyzer as a real-world application

  * Final Goal:
  Find secret messages in Quran based on secret code and muqatta analysis you will perform using novel strategies that haven't been explored before.

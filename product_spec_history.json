        "iteration_goal": "This first increment focuses on building the foundational components for the Quran Secrets Analyzer. It involves creating two Python modules: `quran_data_loader.py` to load Quran data from the specified text file into a list of dictionaries, and `quran_search.py` to implement a basic function that searches for a given word within the loaded Quran text.  A pytest test case `test_search_allah_word` is also included to verify the basic word search functionality for the word 'Allah'. This step ensures the application can read the Quran data and perform a simple search, setting the stage for more advanced features in subsequent iterations."

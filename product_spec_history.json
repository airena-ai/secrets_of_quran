It outlines a clear project vision focused on analyzing the Quran text to find hidden patterns. Essential components include the main driver, text preprocessing functions (for normalization), file reading from the designated data file, and a structured logging system. An integration test for full execution of the main function is also planned, setting up a robust base for future, more advanced analytical features."

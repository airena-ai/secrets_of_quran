        "iteration_goal": "This stage establishes the foundation for the 'Quran Secrets' Python application. It outlines a clear project vision focused on analyzing the Quran text to find hidden patterns. Essential components include the main driver, text preprocessing functions (for normalization), file reading from the designated data file, and a structured logging system. An integration test for full execution of the main function is also planned, setting up a robust base for future, more advanced analytical features."

        "iteration_goal": "This increment focuses on implementing basic word frequency analysis in the Quran Secrets application. It includes developing a function to tokenize the preprocessed Quran text into words, count word frequencies, and log the top N most frequent words to the results.log file. The integration test from the previous iteration will be updated to include this new functionality, ensuring the entire analysis pipeline, including word frequency counting, is tested. This step lays the groundwork for more complex analyses in subsequent iterations by providing initial insights into word distributions within the Quran."

        "iteration_goal": "This increment focuses on enhancing the Quran Secrets application with Arabic root word analysis. It involves integrating an Arabic linguistic library (like CAMeL Tools), developing a function to extract root words from the Quran text, calculating and logging the frequencies of these root words, and updating the integration test to ensure the new functionality is correctly implemented and tested. This step provides a more linguistically nuanced analysis of the Quran compared to simple word frequency counting from the previous iteration."

        "iteration_goal": "This increment focuses on adding bigram (2-word group) frequency analysis to the Quran Secrets application. It involves developing a new function `analyze_bigrams` to generate and count bigrams from the tokenized Quran text. The `main()` function is updated to call this new function and log the top N most frequent bigrams to `results.log`. The integration test is also updated to ensure the new bigram analysis functionality is correctly implemented and tested. This enhancement allows for the analysis of word combinations, providing a more nuanced linguistic analysis of the Quran beyond single word frequencies."

It involves developing a function to identify and count repeating verses within each Surah and across the entire Quran, logging the results, and updating the integration test. This step expands the application's analytical capabilities to the verse level, exploring structural patterns in the Quran and preparing for more advanced analyses in the next iteration."

It includes developing functions for palindromic structure analysis (identifying palindromic words/phrases), mathematical phenomena analysis using Abjad numerals (calculating and analyzing numerical values of verses), and simplified semantic symmetry analysis (measuring word overlap between Surah sections). The `main()` function and integration tests are updated to incorporate these new functionalities, completing the application's development as outlined in the final product goal."

It includes developing functions to analyze palindromic structures within Quranic words, calculate Abjad numerical values for each verse, and perform a simplified semantic symmetry analysis by comparing word overlap between the halves of each Surah. The `main()` function and integration tests will be updated to incorporate these new functionalities, completing the planned analytical capabilities for this phase of the project. The results of these analyses will be logged to the `results.log` file."

It involves creating a function `analyze_verse_repetitions()` to identify and count repeated verses within and across Surahs. The function will process the preprocessed Quran text, log the repeated verses with their counts and locations to `results.log`, and the integration test will be updated to verify this new functionality. This step allows the application to analyze structural patterns at the verse level, building upon the foundational text processing and analysis capabilities established in the previous increment."

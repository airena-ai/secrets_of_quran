        "iteration": 0,
        "date": "2025-04-04",
        "iteration_goal": "This first increment focuses on building the foundational components for the Quran Secrets Analyzer. It involves creating two Python modules: `quran_data_loader.py` to load Quran data from the specified text file into a list of dictionaries, and `quran_search.py` to implement a basic function that searches for a given word within the loaded Quran text.  A pytest test case `test_search_allah_word` is also included to verify the basic word search functionality for the word 'Allah'. This step ensures the application can read the Quran data and perform a simple search, setting the stage for more advanced features in subsequent iterations."

This allows users to search for words and phrases regardless of letter case. Existing and new test cases will be updated to ensure the correct functionality of both case-sensitive and case-insensitive search modes. This improvement makes the search feature more flexible and user-friendly."

        "iteration": 0,
        "date": "2025-04-04",
        "iteration_goal": "This first increment focuses on building the foundational components for the Quran Secrets Analyzer. It involves creating two Python modules: `quran_data_loader.py` to load Quran data from the specified text file into a list of dictionaries, and `quran_search.py` to implement a basic function that searches for a given word within the loaded Quran text.  A pytest test case `test_search_allah_word` is also included to verify the basic word search functionality for the word 'Allah'. This step ensures the application can read the Quran data and perform a simple search, setting the stage for more advanced features in subsequent iterations."

        "date": "2025-04-04",
        "iteration_goal": "This increment focuses on enhancing the Quran Secrets Analyzer by adding the capability to search for word groups (phrases). A new function `search_word_group` will be implemented in `quran_search.py` to find exact word sequences within the Quran text.  A new pytest test case `test_search_word_group` will be created to validate this functionality, ensuring the application can now search for phrases in addition to individual words. This step expands the search capabilities and prepares the ground for more complex analyses in future iterations."

        "iteration": 2,
        "date": "2025-04-04",
        "iteration_goal": "This increment enhances the search functionality of the Quran Secrets Analyzer by adding case-insensitive search capability to both `search_word` and `search_word_group` functions.  This allows users to search for words and phrases regardless of letter case. Existing and new test cases will be updated to ensure the correct functionality of both case-sensitive and case-insensitive search modes. This improvement makes the search feature more flexible and user-friendly."

A new function `search_word_in_surah` will be implemented in `quran_search.py` to enable this feature.  A corresponding pytest test case `test_search_word_in_surah` will be created to validate the functionality, ensuring accurate and case-insensitive searches within specified Surahs. This enhancement allows for more targeted analysis of Quranic text."

Correspondingly, a new pytest test case `test_search_word_group_in_surah` will be created to validate the functionality, ensuring accurate and case-insensitive (and optionally case-sensitive) searches for phrases within specified Surahs. This feature expands the search precision and allows for more targeted analysis of Quranic text by chapter."

It includes creating functions to load the Quran data from the specified text file, perform basic preprocessing such as removing diacritics and normalizing some Arabic letters (\u0649 to \u064a, \u0629 to \u0647), and setting up basic logging to track the process. This stage ensures the data is accessible and minimally cleaned, preparing for more advanced preprocessing and analysis in subsequent steps."
